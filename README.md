# Laboratory work on one-dimensional arrays.

There are three different variants of tasks in this laboratory work. When you open the file, you will see the menu, where you can select the number of the task and see its description.

### Variant 1.

In a one-dimensional array consisting of N real elements, calculate:
1) The sum of the negative elements of the array.
2) The product of the array elements located between the maximum and the minimum elements.
3) Fill it with random values and print it with 10 numbers per row.
4) Arrange the array elements in ascending order.

### Variant 7.

In a one-dimensional array consisting of N integer elements, calculate:
1) The number of the maximum element of the array.
2) The product of the array elements located between the first and the second zero elements.
3) Convert the array so that the first half of the array contains elements in odd positions, and the second half contains elements in even positions.
4) Find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements of the array equal to zero.

### Variant 16.

In a one-dimensional array consisting of N real elements, calculate:
1) The number of negative array elements.
2) The sum of the moduli of the array elements that follow the minimum modulo element.
3) Replace all negative array elements by their squares and order the array elements in ascending order.
4) Find all positive values of the array elements, and choose the smallest among the positive ones.
